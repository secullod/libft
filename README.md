## About
Libft is a project to create a library of functions to be used in any later C project. It is a re-creation of several libc functions and additional functions to help with linked lists, strings, ints, and chars. I will be updating this repository as I find need to create other functions to be used in later projects.

## How to run

First clone the repository and compile the library

    git clone https://github.com/secullod/libft.git
    cd libft
    make

I have included a main.c file which can be used to test any function in the library.

You must first link the main.c file to the library by the below command.

`gcc main.c libft`<br>

Then type `./a.out` to run the functions you have called inside of the main.c file

## What I learned from this project

This project was a chance to become familiar with the basic functions of libc and to additionally create some other similar helpful functions. I improved my understanding of memory management, linked lists, and improved my general coding skills in the C programming language.

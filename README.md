## How to run
Type make in your terminal and after compilation type ./cub3D to run the game in MACOS

If running on Linux type `sudo apt-get install libbsd-dev libx11-dev libxext-dev`
You must also uncomment the Linux specific attributes in the Makefile and change the path to the minilibx-linux in the cub3D.h file
Then type make in your terminal and after compilation type ./cub3D to run the game in Linux

## What I learned from this project
This project requires you to learn a lot about computer graphics which I had not had experience with before this project. You are limited to a very basic graphics library (minilibx) which requires you to print the game pixel by pixel and frame by frame to the screen. I improved my knowledge and skills in the C programming language, data structures, and learned how to implement a raycasting engine and associated trigonometry.
